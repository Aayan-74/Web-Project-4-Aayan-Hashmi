        <p tabindex="7">Naawi-Oodena, meaning “centre of the heart and community,” is more than a development—it is a bold step toward Indigenous self-determination, reconciliation, and community-building. With the help of the Treaty One Nations and Canada Lands Company this urban reserve has been developed on the former Kapyong Barracks site in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and was a collaborative effort to create a space that honors Indigenous culture and history.</p>
