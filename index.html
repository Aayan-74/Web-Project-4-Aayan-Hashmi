    <h1 tabindex="10">Where Will Naawi-Oodena Be Located?</h1>
</section>
<section class="center-content">
    <p tabindex="11">Naawi-Oodena will be located on the former Kapyong Barracks site in Winnipeg, Manitoba which was a military base. The federal government announced the closure of Kapyong Barracks in 2004. It took approximately 15 years. The legal battle started shortly after the 2004 closure and ended in 2019, when the land was officially transferred to the Treaty One Nations.  The site is situated at the intersection of Kenaston Boulevard and McGillivray Boulevard, making it easily accessible from all parts of the city.
        The site is also located near the Assiniboine River, providing a natural setting for the community. The site is currently owned by Canada Lands Company and is being developed in partnership with the Treaty One Nations.
        The site is approximately 160 acres in size and will be home to thousands of people in the future.</p>

        <h1 tabindex="16">How does the plan include Indigenous culture in design and naming?</h1>
    </section>
<section class="center-content">
    <p tabindex="17">The design of Naawi-Oodena is rooted in Indigenous culture and values. The plan includes a central ceremonial site, cultural pavilions, and gathering spaces that reflect the traditions and teachings of the Indigenous peoples of Manitoba. The design also incorporates natural elements such as water, trees, and plants that are significant to Indigenous culture.
        The name Naawi-Oodena itself is in Anishinaabemowin, meaning “centre of the heart and community”. Indigenous place-naming is a key strategy, and Ojibwe names will be used for streets, community spaces, and buildings to reflect Treaty One heritage
